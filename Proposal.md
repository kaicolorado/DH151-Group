Besides programming, I really enjoy watching TV shows and playing the piano in my spare time. I'm excited to learn how to properly analyze data and use it on a GIS map for this project. |

## Overview

Our project will be looking at ...

## Methodology

Our project will involve mapping various data features and having a map layer for each. We will look at standardized scores and arts education policies per state. Having a layer for each data feature will allow users to look at the data that they want to see. We also want to show the correlation between these two feature categories to see if there is any sort of impact that one has on the other. Hopefully this will help people/users understand a relationship (if there is one) that was hard to see or visualize before.

## Technical Scope

- **Git/GitHub**: A way to collaborate with each other and share our files easily.
- **HTML**: Used to implement the main webpage skeleton.
- **CSS**: Used to style the website.
- **JavaScript**: Used to implement Leaflet and more interactive components for our website.
- **Leaflet**: The main mapping library used to visualize geographical locations and overlay our data onto.
- **Python**: May be used to handle/analyze the data and prepare it before it's used.

## Geographic Scope

Our project's geographic scope will be the United States, with each state being a data point. We may look into a more local or more global scope, separating by city/county or looking into other countries, but this will depend on the data we can collect.

## Data

The data we'll be using for this project includes state policies on arts education and per state standardized testing scores, both from national government sources.

The arts education data shows whether each state implements each of the 10 different policies. This data is from 2018.

The standardized testing scores data includes testing for Mathematics, Reading, Science, and Writing. It has this data for many previous years, but the most relevant to us would be the years 2017 and 2019.
