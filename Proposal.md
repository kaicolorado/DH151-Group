## Technical Scope

- **Git/GitHub**: A way to collaborate with each other and share our files easily.
- **HTML**: Used to implement the main webpage skeleton.
- **CSS**: Used to style the website.
- **JavaScript**: Used to implement Leaflet and more interactive components for our website.
- **Leaflet**: The main mapping library used to visualize geographical locations and overlay our data onto.
- **Python**: May be used to handle/analyze the data and prepare it before it's used.

## Geographic Scope

Our project's geographic scope will be the United States, with each state being a data point. We may look into a more local or more global scope, separating by city/county or looking into other countries, but this will depend on the data we can collect.

## Data

The data we'll be using for this project includes state policies on arts education and per state standardized testing scores, both from national government sources.

The arts education data shows whether each state implements each of the 10 different policies. This data is from 2018.

The standardized testing scores data includes testing for Mathematics, Reading, Science, and Writing. It has this data for many previous years, but the most relevant to us would be the years 2017 and 2019.
