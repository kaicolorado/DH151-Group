				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p>
					We are the cARTographers, a duo of mapping students looking to research the effects that artistic
					education has on the American education system. Our project examines artistic education policies and
					standardized test scores to illuminate correlations between these two. We hope to show that exposing
					students to arts in education and supporting creativity has many benefits that most wouldn't think
					of.
				</p>
				<p>
					Arts education has been linked to improvements in various aspects of students' academic careers, and 
					we seek to further investigate this connection. Arts education programs have been associated with 
					improvements in the emotional intelligence of students. Decreases in disciniplinary infractions and 
					increased levels of compassion were recorded among students who participated in arts education 
					<a href="https://kinder.rice.edu/sites/default/files/documents/Investigating%20Causal%20Effects%20of%20
					Arts%20Education%20Experiences%20Final_0.pdf">(Bowen & Kisida 2019)</a>. The impacts of art on a student's 
					overall academic career are expansive and multifaceted. However, our project explores the effects of arts 
					education on academics itself. Studying the direct relationship between arts education and standardized test 
					scores allows us to investigate the effects of arts education on the academic performance of students.

				<h1>How to Use the Map</h1>
				<p>
					Beginning with the blank map, you can select any layers from the top right to overlay data. You can even select
					multiple layers at a time! These layers djisplay either the Overall Score, Arts Education Policies (AEP's), or 
					Standardized Test Scores. The legend at the bottom right helps you keep track of which layers
					you're currently viewing.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once you select one or more layers, the hover function will become active. By hovering over or clicking on a state, 
					you can view in depth data regarding that state's AEP's and Standardized Test Scores. Additionally, a chart will display 
					in the right sidebar with trends of scores over the past 10-30 years.
