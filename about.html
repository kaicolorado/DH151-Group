				<h1>Overview</h1>
				<p>
					We are the cARTographers, a duo of mapping students looking to research the effects that artistic
					education has on the American education system. Our project examines artistic education policies and
					standardized test scores to illuminate correlations between these two. We hope to show that exposing
					students to arts in education and supporting creativity has many benefits that most wouldn't think
					of.
				</p>
			

				<h1>How to Use the Map</h1>
				<p>
					Although the map starts off empty, you can select any layers from the top right to overlay data. For
					now, you can view whether a state has implemented any of the ten art policies. You can even select
					multiple layers at a time! The legend at the bottom right helps you keep track of which layers
					you're currently viewing.
