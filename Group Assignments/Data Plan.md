# Data Plan - Assignment 2.1

## Datasets

- [U.S. Public Education Spending Statistics](https://educationdata.org/public-education-spending-statistics)
- [Arts education policies, by state: 2018](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/statereform/tab2_18.asp)
- [Nation's Report Card State Profiles](https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/profiles/stateprofile)
- [ArtScan](https://www.aep-arts.org/artscan/)

## Description

Data from the listed datasets will be manually converted to CSV or automatically saved as such if possible. It will then be cleaned and analyzed with python into new CSVs with additional data, such as correlations, etc. Each data feature can be toggled as a layer on the map and additional info, like numerical values and a heatmap, will be shown as overlays. On hover, you can view an individual state's info for all the features that are available.

We will also have to download coordinate sets for states, since our map is more based on states rather than single coordinate points.
